Just my personal backup repository of my tint2 collections
## Preview
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/Openbox-Theme-Collections/master/preview.jpg)
I can't give every theme preview one by one, but You can view My Deviant Art [Gallery](http://addy-dclxvi.deviantart.com/gallery/).
Every of my tint2 setups are using these themes.
## Getting Started
You need tint2 with executor support for some of my tint2 themes
## Installation
Do it Yourself :p
## Caution
-Executor scripts & icons path placement are hardcoded, so place this tint2 themes to ~/.config/tint2
-Icons path for *.desktop files are hardcoded to /home/addy/Public/Tint2-Theme-Collections/.launcher*/icons/ (Yup, there is my username), so edit the *.desktop files first
-tiling tint2 is designed for 8 workspaces & 1366 px width, I'm using it for herbstluftwm
-xfwm tint2 is designed for 4 workspaces & 1366 px width
-I don't know about code, most of these are built using tint2conf GUI. So these tint2 config files are very dirty, with so many useless code
## Credits
[BunsenLabs Forum](https://forums.bunsenlabs.org/viewtopic.php?id=254), I learn so much there.
[ARCHLabs Github](https://github.com/ARCHLabs/Archlabs-Tint2-Themes), one of my main resouces for learning.
[Anachron i3blocks](https://github.com/Anachron/i3blocks), I try to execute an i3block script using tint2 executor, without any expectation it will work.
But ridiculously it works! So I slightly modify it to fit into my tint2 themes.
